## What is Virtualization
`Virtualization` is a technology that allows you to run multiple operation systems on one physical computer? It create a virtual version of computer, called [Virtual Machine (VM)](#what-is-a-virtual-machine-vm).  

## What is a Virtual Machine (VM) ?
A virtual machine is a software-based computer that runs inside another computer, created using a **hypervisor**. 
It acts like a real computer with a CPU, memory (RAM), storage and an operating system. 

## How does it work ?
1. The **host** machine is your real computer.
2. The **hypervisor** is a software that creates and runs virutal machines (VirtualBox, VMware...), it shares the host's ressources (CPU, RAM...) with the virtual machineet .  
3. The **guest machine** is the VM that runs unside the host.  


## Advantages of Virtual Machines (VM)
- Run multiple systems (Linux, Windows) on one computer.
- Test software safely (sandbox environment).
- Save money (no need to buy more computers).
- Easy to backup, move, or delete.
- Useful for developers and companies.
