## What is Bare Metal?

**Bare Metal** means using a real physical computer or server **directly**, without any virtualization layer.


## How it Works ?

- The operating system runs **directly** on the physical hardware.
- There is **no virtual machine** or hypervisor between the OS and the hardware.
- The hardware (CPU, RAM, disk) is used only by that system.


## Advantages of Bare Metal

- Maximum performance, no slowdown from virtualization.
- Full control over the hardware.
- Lower latency, faster response.
- Ideal for demanding apps (games, databases..).


## Disadvantages of Bare Metal

- More expensive, no resource sharing.
- Less flexible than virtual machines.
- Harder to backup, move, or clone.
