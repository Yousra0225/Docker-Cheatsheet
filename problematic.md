# Problematic
For example, we want to use Linux (or any other system) on a Windows system. That is something possible with a virtual machine. And that works well on computers or machines with high performance, or on servers.
So in companies, they use servers, and they buy parts of the server â€” like running a Windows on Windows. You connect to the server, and then you access your part.
In another way, they give you a [`virtual machine`](./virtual-machine.md) inside a server.

## Disadvantages of Virtual Machines
- Eats RAM
- Eats CPU
- Eats Disk Space
