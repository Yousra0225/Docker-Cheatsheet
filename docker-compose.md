# Docker Compose

![Docker compose illustration](./src/Docker-Compose.png)  
_Tool for building and running multi-container applications with one command. It manages interaction and networking between containers and their ports._

## docker-compose file (yml)

## 1. Services

_It's a definition of a Docker container configuration within the docker-compose.yml file. It specifies which Docker image to use, dockerfile location , and the containerâ€™s runtime settings (ports, volumes, environment variables, networks). Each service corresponds to one or more containers running the same configuration._

```yml
services:
    frontend:
        build: ./web # Path to the Dockerfile for the frontend
        ports:
            - <host_port>:<container_port>
    backend:
        build: ./api # Path to the Dockerfile for the api
        ports:
            - <host_port>:<container_port>
    database:
        image: postgres:<version> # build the image for db
            - <host_port>:<container_port>
```

| `docker-compose ps`                      | Displays the status of running containers.                            |
| `docker-compose run <service> <command>` | Runs a one-off command in a new container of a specific service.      |
