## What is Docker ?

### Definition

Docker is an open plateform for developing, shipping, and running applications.
The main objectives of Docker :

|                           |                                                                         |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Portability**           | Run the same application across different environments without changes. |
| **Isolation**             | Separate applications and dependencies to avoid version conflicts.      |
| **Lightweight and Fast**  | Use fewer resources and start faster than virtual machines.             |
| **Simplified Deployment** | Automate building, shipping, and running applications.                  |
| **Faster Delivery**       | Reduce time between writing code and running it in production.          |

### Docker Engine

Docker Engine is the program you install on your machine that allows to build images, run containers, and manage container, images, networks ...

### Docker image

Docker image is a snapshot of the complete environment needed for the app â€” including language versions, dependencies, libraries, and configurations.
